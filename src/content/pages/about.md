We are a company supporting transforming education from old school format to blended / flexible delivery. We help New Zealand local institutions implement education technology.


Canvas LMS is our primary tool. We want to help education providers who are using Canvas; we also want to use Canvas LMS to showcase the transformation of education, with our passion for enabling New Zealand institutions to survive and thrive during challenging times.
