Explore the relationship between teachers' experience and Year 11 NCEA exam results through decision tree analysis.

## Understanding Decision Trees

A decision tree is a machine learning algorithm that makes predictions by learning simple decision rules from data. In this analysis, we examine how teachers' years of teaching experience relates to their students' NCEA exam performance.

## About the Dataset

This analysis uses sample data representing Year 11 NCEA exam results paired with the teaching experience of their teachers. The data includes:

- **Teaching Years**: Number of years the teacher has been teaching
- **Exam Score**: Student's NCEA exam score (0-100)
- **Result**: NCEA grade (Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, Excellence)

## How to Read the Tree

The decision tree splits the data at key thresholds of teaching experience. Each branch represents a decision based on the teacher's years of experience, leading to predictions about expected student performance levels.
